# OIBSIP
🌟 AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship — Data Science & Machine Learning
OIBSIP (November–December 2025 Cohort)

Intern: Kamran Ali Yusuf Ali

📌 Overview

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my AICTE Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (November–December 2025).
The internship focused on foundational to intermediate-level Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Python-based predictive modeling.

Over the internship period, I completed five machine learning projects, each covering different aspects of real-world data science:

Data cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Feature engineering

ML model building

Evaluation metrics

Prediction on new data

Project documentation

The internship helped me strengthen my understanding of ML workflows and hands-on project implementation.
