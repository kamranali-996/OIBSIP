🌟 Task 2 — Unemployment Analysis with Python

AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP)

📌 Overview

This project is part of Task 2 of my AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship.
The objective is to analyze unemployment trends in India using Python during the COVID-19 period.

The dataset contains unemployment rates across different regions, rural/urban areas, and dates — making it a powerful dataset for real-world data analysis and visualization.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

Region – Name of the Indian state/region

Date – Date of the collected record

Frequency – Monthly/Annual

Unemployment_Rate (%) – Estimated unemployment rate

Employed – Number of employed individuals

Labour_Participation_Rate (%) – Rate of active participation in the labor market

Area – Rural or Urban data classification

This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle:

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

📊 Tasks Performed
1. Data Loading

Uploaded CSV file into Google Colab

Loaded data using Pandas

Displayed first 5 rows

Verified dataset structure and column names

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Renamed columns for easier access

Converted the Date column into datetime format

Checked for null values

Verified data types for each column

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Region-wise Unemployment (Bar Plot)

Visualized which regions had the highest unemployment levels.

✔️ Unemployment Trend Over Time (Line Plot)

Analyzed how unemployment changed month to month during COVID-19.

✔️ Region-wise Trend Comparison

Used a multi-line plot to show unemployment patterns for each region over time.

✔️ Correlation Heatmap

Plotted relationships between:

Unemployment Rate

Employed

Labour Participation Rate

4. Additional Analysis

Calculated average unemployment per region.

Extracted top unemployment months during COVID peaks.

Compared Rural vs Urban unemployment.

⭐ Insights

Unemployment spiked drastically between April–May 2020, especially during lockdowns.

Regions such as Puducherry, Jharkhand, Bihar, Rajasthan showed some of the highest unemployment rates.

Labour Participation Rate dropped significantly during peak COVID months.

Rural and Urban unemployment patterns showed noticeable differences.

Employment numbers decreased sharply in states with high unemployment rates.

🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze real-world economic data.
Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I successfully:

Cleaned the dataset

Performed trend and regional analysis

Visualized unemployment patterns

Extracted insights related to COVID-19’s economic impact

This task improved my skills in data analysis, visualization, time-series interpretation, and storytelling with data.
